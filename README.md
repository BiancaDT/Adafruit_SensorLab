# Adafruit_SensorLab
Arduino library for scientific sensor readings/fusions/manipulations

**Not for use with small Arduino's like Atmega328/UNO** - this library
includes *all* sensors, requires a SAMD21/Zero/M4/ESP-size chip with
plenty of flash storage :)


## Supported environmental sensors:
  * BMP280 - Temperature & Pressure
  * BME280 - Temperature, Humidity & Pressure
